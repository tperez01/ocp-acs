== Introduction

*Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security* is an enterprise-ready, Kubernetes-native container security solution that enables you to securely build, deploy, and run cloud-native applications anywhere.

In this repository, we will use the GitOps approach to deploy and configure a typical setup of RHACS.


== What I'm doing?

This repository uses an ArgoCD application to deploy RHACS from scratch in your OpenShift cluster. These are currently the available features configured:

* Deploy the RHACS operator on the `rhacs-operator` namespace.
* Deploy an ACS Central instance in the `stackrox` namespace.
* OCP Job to download the `init-bundle` from Central and create the OCP secrets. This Job uses an SA with RBAC to create secrets in the `stackrox` cluster.
* OCP Job to download vulnerabilities from `stackrox.io` and upload them to Central.
* WIP: Create a ConsoleLink to quickly access the Central instance.
* WIP: Create a SecuredCluster to monitor the local cluster.


== Installation

TIP: This installation mode expects you to have a running OCP GitOps instance running in your cluster. If not, you can use this repo to deploy an ArgoCD instance fully configured for this approach: https://github.com/alvarolop/ocp-gitops-playground. Once cloned, use the `./auto-install.sh` script to deploy ArgoCD. 

If you have fulfilled the prerequisite, just apply the ArgoCD application on your cluster:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f application-rhacs.yaml
----

Wait for a few seconds, and you should see how the operator and components are deployed and configured.


== Container image for Jobs

Some of the OCP Jobs that we use in this repo for day 2 configuration of RHACS need several tools like:
* `curl` to download vulnerabilities and check if central is deployed.
* `oc` cli to apply initBundle secrets.
* `roxctl` to download the initBundle and also apply the vulnerabilities.

There isn't a Red Hat supported image containing all the previously mentioned binaries. Therefore, I've created a really basic container image based on the RH-supported `ose-cli` image with the required `roxctl` binary. It is publicly accessible at `quay.io/alopezme/rhacs-roxctl-oc`.

If you want to build your own, you can do it with the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
# Build the container image
podman build -t quay.io/alopezme/rhacs-roxctl-oc:4.3.4 .

# Push it to the container registry
podman push quay.io/alopezme/rhacs-roxctl-oc:4.3.4
----


== Script-based installation

If you don't have an ArgoCD at hand, or you don't want to install it, you can still use the legacy installation mode based on a Shell script. Execute the following command:

[source, bash]
----
./auto-install.sh
----

NOTE: Take into account that this script is limited and currently just deploys ACS in `Online` mode.
